# Problem Statement:
## Impact on Economy: Analyze the money movement by e-commerce by looking at order prices, freight and others.
- ### Get the % increase in the cost of orders from year 2017 to 2018 (include months between Jan to Aug only).You can use the "payment_value" column in the payments table to get the cost of orders
```sql
// Month by month
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_purchase_timestamp) AS month,
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_purchase_timestamp) = 2017
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN 1 AND
    8
    THEN p.payment_value END) AS month_sale2017,
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_purchase_timestamp) = 2018
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN 1 AND
    8
    THEN p.payment_value END) AS month_sale2018
    FROM
    target_SQL.orders o
    JOIN
    target_SQL.payments p
    ON
    o.order_id = p.order_id
    WHERE
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN 1 AND 8
    GROUP BY
    month
    order by month
)
SELECT
month,
((month_sale2018 - month_sale2017) / month_sale2017) * 100 AS
percent_increase
FROM
CTE;



//Overall growth
with CTE as (
  select sum(case when extract(year from order_purchase_timestamp)=2017
  then p.payment_value else 0 end) as year2017,
  sum(case when extract(year from order_purchase_timestamp)=2018 then
  p.payment_value else 0 end) as year2018
  from target_SQL.orders o join target_SQL.payments p
  on o.order_id=p.order_id
  where extract(month from order_purchase_timestamp) between 1 and 8)
select (year2018-year2017)/year2017*100 as percent_increase
from CTE

```

- ### Calculate the Total & Average value of order price for each state.

 ```sql
select c.customer_state,
  sum(oi.price) as total_value,
  avg(oi.price) as average_value
  from target_SQL.customers c
  join target_SQL.orders o
  on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
  join target_SQL.order_items oi
  on oi.order_id=o.order_id
 group by c.customer_state
 order by total_value desc
```

- ### Calculate the Total & Average value of order freight for each state.

 ```sql
 select c.customer_state,
  sum(oi.freight_value) as total_value,
  sum(oi.freight_value)/count(*) as average_value
  from target_SQL.customers c
  join target_SQL.orders o
  on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
  join target_SQL.order_items oi
  on oi.order_id=o.order_id
group by c.customer_state
order by total_value desc

```
